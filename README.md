# Neighborhood Map (React):

A Web App about:
"MircoÂ´s favorite cafe spots in Berlin-Mitte" (Germany)
(Final Project of Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree)

## To get started:

* download all project files to one folder
* "cd" into that folder
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start` (a Browser tap will open)

## For your information:

I developed this app as part of the [udacity FEND course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) 

and the following NPM Packages were used:

* [google-maps-react](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react)
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

The Google Maps API was used to display the map.
Some Venue-Data from https://de.foursquare.com/ were fetched by API to give some further Information about the Coffee Places.
